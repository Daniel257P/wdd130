        <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Paulino, I’m from the Dominican Republic, 
        and I love technology, creativity, and finding new ways to solve problems. 
        I’m studying Software Development because I want to bring my ideas to life and
        build projects that can make a difference. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tech,
        learning about data, and working on things that push me to grow.</p>
