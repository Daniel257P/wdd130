            <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Paulino, I’m from the Dominican Republic, and I love technology, creativity, and finding new ways to solve problems. 
                I’m studying Software Development because I want to bring my ideas to life and build projects that can make a difference. In my free time, 
                I enjoy exploring new tech, learning about data, and working on things that push me to grow.
                <br>
                <br>
                A very important part of my life is my faith. I made my first covenants in the Santo Domingo Dominican Republic Temple, which makes it especially meaningful to me.
                In 2018, I married my wife in the Sacramento California Temple, a day that changed my life forever. The Oakland California Temple also holds a special place in my heart, 
                since it was one of the first temples I visited while I was dating my wife. Each of these temples—Santo Domingo, Sacramento, and Oakland—represents a different but deeply 
                cherished part of my journey.</p>

            <p>The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean nation located on the eastern side of Hispaniola, 
            part of the Greater Antilles archipelago. It shares its only land border with Haiti to
            the west and is separated from Puerto Rico by the Mona Passage to the east. Covering about 
            48,671 square kilometers (18,792 sq mi), the country is the second-largest in the Antilles by 
            both size and population. In 2024, its population was estimated at 11.4 million people, with 
            roughly 3.6 million residing in the capital and largest city, Santo Domingo.</p>
